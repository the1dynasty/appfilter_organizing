NOTE: You must have an appfilter with correct corresponding ComponentInfo already included in it.

Step 1: Add all of your drawables to a folder.
Step 2: Add the appfilter.xml to the same folder.
Step 3: Add this script to the same folder as the above files.
Step 4: run the command "./appfilter_script.sh" to execute this script.

A new file will be created in that folder called "appfilter_organized.xml" leaving your original appfilter.xml untouched. Your new file can be renamed and added to your themes.


The provided script was created mostly by ChatGPT. I had to modify some parts and did some troubleshooting to get it to work the way I needed it. But I am not a programmer lol.
